# Privacy Policy for StudyPlannerAI - Facial Expression Analysis Feature

This Privacy Policy outlines how StudyPlannerAI collects, uses, stores, and protects facial data when you enable the Facial Expression Analysis feature. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly.

## 1. Data Collection

When you enable the Facial Expression Analysis feature, StudyPlannerAI will collect the following:
*   **Facial Image Data:** Frames from your device's camera will be captured during active study sessions. These images are processed in real-time for facial expression analysis.
*   **Facial Expression Data:** Analysis results, such as detected emotions (e.g., happy, sad, neutral, focused, distracted), confidence scores, and timestamps, will be generated.

## 2. Use of Data

The collected facial image and expression data are used exclusively for the following purposes:
*   **Real-time Feedback:** To provide immediate feedback on your engagement and emotional state during study sessions, helping you to optimize your learning.
*   **Personalized Study Recommendations:** To inform and adjust study recommendations, pacing, and content based on your observed engagement patterns.
*   **Research and Improvement:** To analyze aggregated, anonymized data to improve the accuracy of our facial expression analysis models and enhance the overall effectiveness of StudyPlannerAI.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

*   **Facial Image Data:** Raw facial image data (video frames) are **not stored** on our servers or your device after real-time processing, unless explicitly consented to for specific research purposes (which would require separate, explicit consent).
*   **Facial Expression Data:** Analyzed facial expression data (e.g., "focused" at timestamp X) may be stored temporarily or permanently, linked to your user account and study sessions, to provide historical insights and personalize future recommendations. This data will be anonymized or pseudonymized where possible.
*   **Retention:** We retain facial expression data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or as required by law. You can request deletion of your data at any time through your account settings.

## 4. User Consent

*   **Explicit Consent Required:** We will **never** activate the Facial Expression Analysis feature or access your camera without your explicit, informed consent.
*   **Consent Mechanism:** Before enabling the feature, you will be presented with a clear explanation of what data will be collected, how it will be used, and this Privacy Policy. You must actively agree to these terms.
*   **Revocation of Consent:** You can revoke your consent and disable the Facial Expression Analysis feature at any time through your StudyPlannerAI settings. Upon revocation, no further facial data will be collected or processed.

## 5. Data Sharing

StudyPlannerAI will **not** share your facial image data or identifiable facial expression data with any third parties, except:
*   With your explicit consent.
*   When required by law or legal process.
*   With service providers who assist us in operating the feature (e.g., cloud-based facial analysis APIs), under strict confidentiality agreements and only for the purposes outlined herein.

## 6. Data Security

We implement robust technical and organizational measures to protect your facial data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:
*   Data encryption in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
*   Access controls and authentication mechanisms.
*   Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

## 7. Your Rights

You have the right to:
*   Access the facial expression data we hold about you.
*   Request correction of inaccurate data.
*   Request deletion of your data.
*   Object to the processing of your data.
*   Withdraw your consent at any time.
